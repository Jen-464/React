### Vite-Project

Command: npm create vite@latest, more can be found [here](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project)

Will be using: React framework && JS + SWC variant

To run: npm run dev

Deleted: assets & public folder and css files

### Things I learned

- Components only return 1 element
- Components can be small as a button & big as a web page
- <></> called ankle brackets
- useState helps page be interactive instead of static
- useState takes in a default value
